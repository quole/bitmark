Project Bitmark is a multi faceted project which aims to provide:

1. A **stable cryptographic currency network** which balances the requirements of all parties involved.
2. A **far reaching adoption initiative** under the guise of novel reputation+currency system called [Marking](https://github.com/project-bitmark/marking/wiki)

This repository contains the Bitmark cryptograpic currency software, and a wiki which provides all details pertaining to the software, it's configuration and the rationale of all design decisions.

Bitmark aims to be a relatively stable, user focused, crypto currency, which refines and implements maturing innovations from the crypto currency sector.

### Overview
**Technically**: Light and stable with a modern codebase, [maturing features from the alternative currency sector](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki#maturing-innovations) which *benefit* users added on a faster timeline than bitcoin. Think of it more as [standardization rather than innovation](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki#relatively-stable).

**User focused**: Daily development effort and innovation goes in to making bitmark as [user friendly, and simple to integrate](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki#user-focused) as possible.

**Earned Value**: Every aspect of Project Bitmark is focused on earned value. It's a project to make a viable every day currency, any value will be earned. 

**Longevity**: The Bitmark network has been operational since mid July, 2014. A well funded Bitmark Foundation is being created and funded by the community to support long term development. 

**Distribution**: A [configuration](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki#block-chain-parameters) which aims to ensure [fair distribution](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki/Currency#supply-and-distribution) whilst using [proven PoW](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki#proof-of-work) which has had substantial investment in hardware. Extensive distribution of the currency is achieved through wide spread adoption under the banner of [Marking](https://github.com/project-bitmark/marking/wiki).

**Balance**: Every aspect of Bitmark has been designed in order to balance the interests of everybody involved or associated with the project. This includes [Investor Public Mining (IPM)](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki/IPM-Pool) which balances Investors, Miners, and Developers in a way that is mutually beneficial and which critically enables those at the core to provide the best network experience to those who rely on it, the users.
